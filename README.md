Learning/Artificial Intelligence problems. My apps [VoyaGenius](http://thevoyagenius.com) use Machine Learning algorithms
to help plan trips based on user interests. I graduated with a Masters from [Communication and Digital Signal Processing](http://cdsp.neu.edu) from Northeastern Univeristy, Boston. My [thesis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=elec_comp_theses) was in Speech Recogntion at BBN Technologies, Cambridge.

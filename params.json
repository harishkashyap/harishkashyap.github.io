{"name":"Harish Krishnamurthy","tagline":"hkashyap@icloud.com","body":"## About Me\r\n\r\nI hail from the [Royal City of Mysore](http://royalmaisur.com), India and currently live and work in the Boston area. I enjoy solving Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence problems. I graduated with a Masters from [Communication and Digital Signal Processing](http://cdsp.neu.edu) from Northeastern Univeristy, Boston. My [thesis](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=elec_comp_theses) was in Speech Recognition at BBN Technologies, Cambridge. Later I interned at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs in Data Analytics and Speech. \r\n\r\n## Papers\r\n* ”Generating Facies Probability Cubes” - US Patent filed, March 2010\r\n\r\n* Harish K Krishnamurthy, Study of algorithms to combine multiple automatic speech recogni- tion(ASR)system outputs, Master’s thesis, [pdf], Northeastern University, Boston MA 02115, April 2009.\r\n\r\n* Harish Krishnamurthy, Spyros Matsoukas, John Makhoul. - Combining multiple speech outputs by extending Bayesian combination (BAYCOM) for word recognition.
